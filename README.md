Looks for invite links and posts them in a target server.
  
# Requirements
Node.js 6.0.0 or newer  
Discord.js plugin
  
# Installation Instructions
Install Node.js 6.0.0 or above if you dont have it already
Once you have Node.js installed, run:  
``npm install --save discord.js``  
in a command prompt.  
Download ``crawler.js`` and ``config.josn`` and save them into a folder.
Edit ``config.json`` to the correct settings.  
Change token to your bot's token.  
Change serverid to the id of the server to post the links in.  
Open a command prompt and cd into the directory you saved the files in.

If everything was configured properly, the bot should start scanning for invite links. Add the bot to servers in which you want to crawl invite links from.
